## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

This project is built using:  

- **MongoDB**: For the database, enabling seamless data storage and retrieval.  
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for handling routes and server-side logic.  
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building a dynamic and interactive UI.  
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript.
